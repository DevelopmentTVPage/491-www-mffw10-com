    "description": "Whether you're looking for a half-up hairstyle, a ponytail or a bun, we've got the perfect braided look for you. Learn how to upgrade these braids with this easy hairstyle tutorial. You can use any accessories you have at home. They only take a few minutes to create using #GarnierStyle. \n\nSTYLE 1: BRAIDED HALF-UP HALF-DOWN\nStart by braiding a section of hair behind each ear. Thread the braids through a ring then pin the braids behind each ear. To finish the look, mist a brush with Fructis Sheer Set Hairspray and smooth the ends of your hair.\n\nSTYLE 2: BRAIDED SIDE BUN\nSpray your roots with Fructis De-Constructed Texture Tease. Section the hair on one side of your face pulling the rest into a ponytail. French braid the loose section half way then add it to the pony. Braid the ponytail then gently separate it to loosen it. Secure a long necklace to base of the braid,  twist it into a bun and secure with a bobby pin. Wrap the necklace around the bun and finish the look with Fructis Sheer Set Hairspray.\n\nSTYLE 3: BRAIDED DOUBLE PONYTAIL\nDivide your hair into two sections. Secure the top section with an elastic and repeat on the bottom section. Spritz hair with Fructis Sheer Set Hairspray to tame flyaways. Braid the top pony, combining the bottom ponytail and secure with an elastic. Gently separate the braid to create a fuller look. To finish the look, pin a fancy brooch to the top of your braid.  \n\nLearn more about the products to get this look:\nFructis Style Texture Tease: http:\/\/www.garnierusa.com\/products\/styling\/texturizing\/spray\/de-constructed-texture-tease.aspx\nFructis Style Sheer Set Hairspray: http:\/\/www.garnierusa.com\/products\/styling\/hairsprays-and-hold\/sheer-set-hair-spray\/sheer-set-ultra-strong-hold.aspx\n\nFor more hairstyle inspiration, visit us at: http:\/\/www.garnierusa.com\/hairstyles\nFind us on Instagram! @garnierusa http:\/\/instagram.com\/garnierusa\nLike us on Facebook! https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/garnierusa\nFollow us on Twitter! @garnierusa https:\/\/twitter.com\/garnierusa",
